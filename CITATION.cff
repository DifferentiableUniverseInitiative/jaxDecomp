abstract: >-
  JAX reimplementation and bindings for NVIDIA's cuDecomp library,
  enabling multi-node parallel FFTs and halo exchanges directly in
  low-level NCCL/CUDA-Aware MPI from JAX code. jaxDecomp provides
  both a pure JAX backend for easy deployment and an optional
  cuDecomp backend for advanced MPI/NCCL communication patterns.
  All functions are JIT-compatible and support automatic differentiation.
